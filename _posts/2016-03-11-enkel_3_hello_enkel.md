###Approach
During project development I will strongly rely on a top-down approach. Instead of going through the details of each module separately I will describe all of them at once in the most minimalistic way. After each iteration I will add some new feature to the project describing it in more detail.

###Let's ```print hello```
So let's start by creating the most minimalistic implementation to make first line of an Enkel language be executed on a JVM.
