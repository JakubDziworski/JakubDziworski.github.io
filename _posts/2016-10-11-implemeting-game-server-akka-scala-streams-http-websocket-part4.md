This is the last part where I code a client.

Thanks to everyone who watched the series!
I know at times it was a bit hard to follow.
I've made a mistake of coding and trying talk at the same time. 
It turns out it is a really hard and you cannot fully focus on both.
Next time I'm going to do one thing at the time and then merge it in post-production.
